# Resume-Ranker-

Finding the best candidate for a specific job from a recruitment process within the shortest time is a challenge for a company nowadays. Nowadays, there are too many applicants, and it takes too much time and effort to get suitable candidates for a companyâ€™s job. The Human Resources team needs more workforce to scrutinize the resumes or CVs of candidates.

The project aims to develop a more flexible, realistic and expert resume ranker system that ranks the resumes effectively and efficiently and gives the best candidate or candidates. This is a simple Django-based resume ranker website where recruiter users post jobs, candidate-users apply for the job, fill in the required data, and upload resumes. The system ranks the resumes based on the document similarity of the job description and the resumes using the KNN model. It saves human efforts, time, and cost.
